As the city grows and develops, it becomes increasingly important to examine and understand it quantitiatively.\n\nThe objective of this capstone project is to analyse and explore the best locations in the city of Helsinki to open a new shopping mall. By following data science methodology and applying Clustering technique, this project aims to provide solutions to answer the following business questions: \n- Where is the potential area to open a shopping mall?\n- How many potential areas are in Helsinki? \n- Which areas do they share similar characteristics to each other?
